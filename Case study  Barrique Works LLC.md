Case study: „Barrique Works LLC“
================================

What they do?
-------------

Barrique Works LLC (BW) is company that produces barrels for winemakers

What are the challenges?
------------------------

Company wants:
-   To implement their business processes in digital form without or with minimum paper forms. This includes:
    -   Vacation requests
    -   Car usage logs
    -   Work orders
    -   Customer complaints
-   To asses sales potential in region by surveying existing and potential customers
-   To implement Quality Management (ISO 9001:2015)

What are the options?
---------------------

-   Implement various free and/or commercial products for each challenge: CRM, BMP, etc.. This option is most complicated and has many unknowns regarding TCO (Total cost of ownership), deadline and overall effectiveness.
-   Order custom LOB (Line of business) solution. This is probably most expensive option, and deadline and overall success is not guaranteed – It depends on quality of hired company as on BW itself.
-   Use “DataChief” (DC) as tool to implement requirements in-house. DC is free, flexible and can be implemented in phases. Decision has been made to use DC.
